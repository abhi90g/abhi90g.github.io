# Grocery-App

This app lets you add any items, quantity and category for each item. This is created as a tool to keep track of grocery items bought for shared household use as well as for individual use.

This also let you see a list of item name within the basket and filter the list by item name when typed in the search bar inside modal screen.

To Run:

`git clone https://github.com/abhi90g/Grocery-App.git`  
`npm install`  to get all dependencies
`cd Grocery-App`
`npm start`  
     
  
For this app No scaffolding tools such as 'create-react-app' is used. Also no 'npm eject' on this. Using `style-loader` and `css-loader` I'm converting saas to css through `sass --watch src/styles/scss:src/styles/css`. This also required respective loaders in the webpack.config.js
